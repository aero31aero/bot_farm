# bot_farm
This project will have various examples of deploying bot code for Zulip.

Note that this project contains files in the "zulip" directory that
are copied from https://github.com/zulip/zulip under the terms of its
license (Apache).

The rest of this project is under the MIT license.

The goal for this project is to serve as a template for folks who need
help deploying Zulip bots in their own customized setups.  It is not
meant to be reusable in the sense that a framework or library would be
reused.
